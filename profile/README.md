[One Community Global](https://onecommunityglobal.org/) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit creating open-source solutions for sustainable living. We're a global team of volunteers building replicable systems for [housing](https://www.onecommunityglobal.org/highest-good-housing/), [food](https://www.onecommunityglobal.org/highest-good-food/), [energy](https://www.onecommunityglobal.org/highest-good-energy/), [education](https://www.onecommunityglobal.org/highest-good-education/), and more — all shared for **The Highest Good of All**.

One of our current online focus is the [Highest Good Network](https://www.onecommunityglobal.org/highest-good-network/)®, a full-stack web application designed to facilitate collaboration, time tracking, and transparent impact reporting. It's designed to empower sustainable projects and open-source communities by providing tools for labor and materials tracking, social architecture planning, educational program management, and governance systems.

## Help Build the Highest Good Network®
In a world where the lines between work and play are blurring, we're building tools to manage and scale collaborative, mission-driven projects.

Together, we've created:

💻 **A web-based platform** for tracking tasks and time — because productivity should be as seamless as the cause is awesome.

🧩 **A modular, full-stack architecture** (using React + Node + MongoDB)

📚 **Dev-friendly docs and open guides** to help anyone to jump in and start building.

🌎 **A global contributor community** of passionate humans coding for good.
